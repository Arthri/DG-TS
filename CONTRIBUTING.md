## Contributing Issues

### Before Submitting an Issue
If the issue you have already exists, instead of filing a new one simply make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests
* Do not post multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
* Explain as much as you can in detail about your issue or feature request, so that any other person will understand it

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.
